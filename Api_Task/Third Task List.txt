1. Validate API Works (Basic Status Check)
Test Objective: Verify that the API is up and running.
Test Steps: Send a GET request with a valid name parameter (naira), and check that the status code is 200 (OK).

2. Validate Returned Parameters
Test Objective: Ensure that the API returns the expected fields in the response body.
Test Steps: Send a GET request with the name parameter and validate the response contains name, age, and count keys.

3. Validate Logic of Parameters
Test Objective: Verify that the returned name, age, and count parameters follow correct logic.
Test Steps: Extract and validate:
name matches the provided name parameter.
age is greater than 0.
count is greater than 0.

4. Validate Response Not Affected by Invalid Parameters
Test Objective: Ensure the API response is not affected when an invalid parameter (WrongParam) is sent.
Test Steps: Send a request with a valid name and an invalid parameter and validate the status code is still 200 and the returned data is valid.

5. Validate When Sending Request Without name Parameter
Test Objective: Ensure that the API responds with an error when the required name parameter is missing.
Test Steps: Send a request without the name parameter and verify that the status code is not 200.

6. Test for Invalid Names (Wrong Names Should Not Return Data)
Test Objective: Ensure that invalid names (empty, special characters, or non-English characters) do not return valid age or count data.
Test Steps: Test with various invalid names and assert that the API returns age as null and count as 0.

7. Test Performance (Response Time)
Test Objective: Verify that the API response time is under an acceptable limit.
Test Steps: Send a request with a valid name and measure the response time. Assert that the response time is less than 2000 ms.
